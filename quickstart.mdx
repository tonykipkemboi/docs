To get started with CrewAI, you need to have `crewai` and `crewai-tools` installed. 
If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](/installation).

Once you have installed the packages, you can start creating your own agents, tools, and tasks.

## Installation and Project Setup

CrewAI uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Installation">
  First, if you haven't already, install Poetry:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      pip install poetry
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  Then, install CrewAI if you haven't already:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      pip install crewai crewai-tools
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new CrewAI project using the YAML Template Configuration">
  To create a new CrewAI project, run the following CLI (Command Line Interface) command:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      crewai create crew <project_name>
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  This command creates a new project folder with the following structure:
    <CodeGroup>     
      ```markdown Directory Structure
      my_project/
      ├── .gitignore
      ├── pyproject.toml
      ├── README.md
      ├── .env
      └── src/
          └── my_project/
              ├── __init__.py
              ├── main.py
              ├── crew.py
              ├── tools/
              │   ├── custom_tool.py
              │   └── __init__.py
              └── config/
                  ├── agents.yaml
                  └── tasks.yaml
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  You can now start developing your crew by editing the files in the `src/my_project` folder. 
  The `main.py` file is the entry point of the project, the `crew.py` file is where you define your crew, the `agents.yaml` file is where you define your agents, 
  and the `tasks.yaml` file is where you define your tasks.
  </Step>   
  <Step title="Customize your project">
  To customize your project, you can:
    - Modify `src/my_project/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents.
    - Modify `src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks.
    - Modify `src/my_project/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools, and specific arguments.
    - Modify `src/my_project/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks.
    - Add your environment variables into the `.env` file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Build your first CrewAI Agent

<Tip>
  Let's create a simple crew that will help us `research` and `report` on the `latest AI developments`.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your crew">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      crewai create crew latest-ai-development
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify the following files as needed to fit your use case">  
  You can also copy and run them as is.
    ```yaml agents.yaml
    # src/my_project/config/agents.yaml
    researcher:
      role: >
        {topic} Senior Data Researcher
      goal: >
        Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
      backstory: >
        You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
        developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
        information and present it in a clear and concise manner.
          
    reporting_analyst:
      role: >
        {topic} Reporting Analyst
      goal: >
        Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings
      backstory: >
        You're a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail. You're known for
        your ability to turn complex data into clear and concise reports, making
        it easy for others to understand and act on the information you provide.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>  
    ```yaml tasks.yaml
    # src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml
    research_task:
      description: >
        Conduct a thorough research about {topic}
        Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
        the current year is 2024.
      expected_output: >
        A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}
      agent: researcher

    reporting_task:
      description: >
        Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
        Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
      expected_output: >
        A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
        Formatted as markdown without '```'
      agent: reporting_analyst
      output_file: report.md
    ```
  </Step>   
  <Step>  
    ```python crew.py
    # src/my_project/crew.py
    from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
    from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
    from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

    @CrewBase
    class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
      """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

      @agent
      def researcher(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
          config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
          verbose=True,
          tools=[SerperDevTool()]
        )

      @agent
      def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
          config=self.agents_config['reporting_analyst'],
          verbose=True
        )

      @task
      def research_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
          config=self.tasks_config['research_task'],
        )

      @task
      def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
          config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task'],
          output_file='report.md'
        )

      @crew
      def crew(self) -> Crew:
        """Creates the LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
        return Crew(
          agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
          tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
          process=Process.sequential,
          verbose=True,
        ) 
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feel free to pass custom inputs to your crew"> 
  For example, you can pass the `topic` input to your crew to customize the research and reporting to medical llms or any other topic.
    ```python main.py
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # src/my_project/main.py
    import sys
    from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

    def run():
      """
      Run the crew.
      """
      inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
      }
      LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your environment variables">
  Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your `.env` file:
    - An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (or other LLM API key): `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
    - A [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key: `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lock and install the dependencies">
    Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command but first, navigate to your project directory:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      cd my_project
      crewai install
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your crew">
  To run your crew, execute the following command in the root of your project:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Terminal
      crewai run
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your final report">
  You should see the output in the console and the `report.md` file should be created in the root of your project with the final report.
  </Step>
</Steps>

In addition to the [sequential process](../how-to/sequential-process), you can use the [hierarchical process](../how-to/hierarchical-process),
which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results. 

You can learn more about the core concepts [here](/concepts).
