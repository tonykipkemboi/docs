To get started with CrewAI, you need to have `crewai` and `crewai-tools` installed. 
If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](/installation).

Once you have installed the packages, you can start creating your own agents, tools, and tasks.

## Installation and Project Setup

CrewAI uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Installation">
  First, if you haven't already, install Poetry:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      pip install poetry
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  Then, install CrewAI if you haven't already:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      pip install crewai crewai-tools
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new CrewAI project using the YAML Template Configuration">
  To create a new CrewAI project, run the following CLI (Command Line Interface) command:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      crewai create crew <project_name>
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  This command creates a new project folder with the following structure:
    | File/Directory          | Description                                      |
    |:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
    | `my_project/`           | Root directory of the project                    |
    | ├── `.gitignore`        | Specifies files and directories to ignore in Git |
    | ├── `pyproject.toml`    | Project configuration and dependencies           |
    | ├── `README.md`         | Project documentation                            |
    | ├── `.env`              | Environment variables                            |
    | └── `src/`              | Source code directory                            |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── `my_project/` | Main application package                      |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── `__init__.py` | Marks the directory as a Python package     |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── `main.py`     | Main application script                    |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── `crew.py`     | Crew-related functionalities                |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── `tools/`      | Custom tools directory                      |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;│   ├── `custom_tool.py` | Custom tool implementation              |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;│   └── `__init__.py`    | Marks tools directory as a package       |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── `config/`     | Configuration files directory               |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── `agents.yaml`  | Agent configurations                    |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── `tasks.yaml`   | Task configurations                      |

  You can now start developing your crew by editing the files in the `src/my_project` folder. 
  The `main.py` file is the entry point of the project, the `crew.py` file is where you define your crew, the `agents.yaml` file is where you define your agents, 
  and the `tasks.yaml` file is where you define your tasks.
  </Step>   
  <Step title="Customize your project">
  To customize your project, you can:
    - Modify `src/my_project/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents.
    - Modify `src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks.
    - Modify `src/my_project/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools, and specific arguments.
    - Modify `src/my_project/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks.
    - Add your environment variables into the `.env` file.
  </Step>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Lock and install the dependencies">
    Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command but first, navigate to your project directory:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      cd my_project
      crewai install
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your crew">
  To run your crew, execute the following command in the root of your project:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Terminal
      crewai run
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your final report">
  You should see the output in the console and the `report.md` file should be created in the root of your project with the final report.

  Here's an example of what the report should look like:
